# Announcing npmx: a fast, modern browser for the npm registry

Today we're releasing the alpha of [npmx.dev](https://npmx.dev), a fast, modern browser for the npm registry.

npmx is about speed and simplicity: making it quicker and easier to find, evaluate, and manage npm packages. It gives you useful data &ndash; like install size, module format, and outdated dependencies &ndash; right where you need it, so you can make better decisions about the packages you use.

We're also building social features into npmx because open source is better when it's easier to connect with the people behind the packages.

## The need for npmx

On January 22nd 2026, Daniel Roe, open-source maintainer and founder, and leader of the [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) core
team, had an idea, and made
[the first commit to the npmx repository](https://github.com/npmx-dev/npmx.dev/commit/e39e56c08fd1e7bdb556c8565c6b11b3c34c8934).
The next day, [Daniel posted on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/danielroe.dev/post/3md3cmrg56k2r) asking
about people's frustrations with the npm experience &ndash; both on the web and in the CLI. The responses came flooding in:
code browsing, missing data, trust signals, dependency visibility, and the general friction around publishing.

Clearly, there was an appetite for something better &ndash; and people were willing to help build it.

## The power of community

Things moved fast. Within 24 hours, 49 pull requests had been opened. Two weeks later, the
[community had contributed 1000 issues and PRs](https://github.com/npmx-dev/npmx.dev/issues/1000) &ndash; that's roughly
_one every 20 minutes_, around the clock. With
[over 105 contributors](https://github.com/npmx-dev/npmx.dev/graphs/contributors) and 1500 stars in just 16 days, npmx became one of the most active early open-source projects we've seen.

[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=npmx-dev/npmx.dev&type=date&legend=top-left)](https://www.star-history.com/#npmx-dev/npmx.dev&type=date&legend=top-left)

We don't think this happened by accident. From the start, npmx prioritized accessibility, internationalization, and working in the open. This attracted people who care about those things &ndash; and who are good at collaborating because of it. The result is a genuinely diverse, global community that's a joy to be part of.

## What you can do with npmx today

Search and view details about packages, users and organizations available on npm, and dive deeper into the code. Plus get detailed information on:

- download statistics
- outdated dependency warnings
- module format (ESM/CJS)
- install size
- [JSR](https://jsr.io/) cross-reference
- multi-provider repo support
- version range resolution
- package likes and social features
- performance recommendations powered by [e18e](https://e18e.dev/)

You can also launch [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), and other demo environments directly from package READMEs. Additionally, npmx is available in 19 languages, has light and dark mode, and is designed to be keyboard-friendly throughout.

## The future of npmx

We want to build a better package browsing and management experience for everyone in the JavaScript ecosystem. We're moving fast, but we don't have all the answers. Right now we're building for our peers: open-source developers who work with packages daily and are willing to try something early and tell us what's working and what isn't. That feedback is how we'll get to beta.

## Join us at npmx

We'd love for you to get involved. Even if you've never contributed to open source before &ndash; you are welcome. If you're not sure where to start, Salma Alam-Naylor has written
[a ten-step guide to making your first open-source contribution on GitHub](https://whitep4nth3r.com/blog/how-to-make-your-first-open-source-contribution/).

Below this post, you'll also find articles from npmx contributors sharing their own perspectives and experiences.

This npmx alpha is intentionally early. We want real-world feedback from _you_ to guide what we work on next. Try [npmx](https://npmx.dev) today, tell us what you think at [chat.npmx.dev](https://chat.npmx.dev), [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/npmx-dev/npmx.dev/issues), or submit a pull request. And [follow npmx.dev on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/npmx.dev) to keep up with what we're building.

Thank you to everyone who has contributed so far &ndash; code, docs, testing, community, and more. You're the ones building this.
